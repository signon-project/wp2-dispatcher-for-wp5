# SignON WP5 Dispatcher

The SignON WP5 Dispatcher repository is part of [SignON](https://signon-project.eu/) an EU H2020 research and innovation funded project.  

The SignON Dispatchers (WP3/WP4/WP5) were implemented to allow the SignON Pipeline Components to analyse a message without implementing the communication channels between them nor with the Object Storage.  
The message from the SignON Orchestrator is passed to the first SignON Dispatcher (WP3) that:
1. retrieves the audio/video data from the Object Storage (if any)
2. communicates to the relevant SignON Pipeline Components
3. passes the message to the next SignON Dispatcher with a “piggyback” approach

The last SignON Dispatcher (WP5) returns the message to the SignON Orchestrator.

For further details please refer to public deliverable [D2.5 - Final release of the Open SignON Framework](https://signon-project.eu/publications/public-deliverables/).

**N.B. In order to improve the performances and speed-up the loading of the avatar rendering (animated by the 3D Model Engine), the 3D Model Engine is not a service called by this dispatcher, but it has been integrated directly in the SignON Mobile App.**

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
- Python: v3.8
- Message Broker: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- Object Storage: [MinIO](https://min.io/)

For further details about the configuration of the components please refer to [SignON Framework Docker Compose](https://github.com/signon-project/wp2-framework-docker-compose).

### Installation 
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Set the parameters in `src/config.yml`
2. Start the SignON WP5 Dispatcher
    ```bash
    python dispatcher.py -c <config-file-path>
    ```
    > N.B. If ```<config-file-path>``` is not specified the project will use the config file in the same folder you are currently in.

    Alternatively, to launch the project Dockerised:
    ```bash
    docker build --tag=signon-wp5-dispatcher:X.X.X .
    docker run -d --rm --name signon-wp5-dispatcher -v path/to/config.yml:/config.yml signon-wp5-dispatcher:X.X.X
